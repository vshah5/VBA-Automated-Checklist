# VBA-Automated-Checklist
This is a skeletal version of an automated VBA checklist I created for my prior workplace to help our internal auditor with internal control requirements. This checklist was manual prior to the creation of this automated checklist and it helped save time, save paper, was user-friendly, and added additional features which enforced segregation of duties. The checklist was first used by the preparers who accessed the file and filled out their checkmarks/NA for each fund preparation requirement and then by simply pressing a button, they locked their column of the spreadsheet and had their initials and timestamp recorded. This process was repeated by the reviewer and final manager. This skeletal version is trimmed down from the original document and the code has been locked for proprietary reasons.
